                        application for mobile and handheld devices (the "App"). The Website and the App are jointly referred to as the "Platform".
                        Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you use the services. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use,
                        you may not use the services on the Platform, and we request you to uninstall the App. By installing, downloading

                        Privacy Policy and Take Down Policy) as posted on the Platform and amended from time to time,
                        which takes effect on the date on which you download, install or use the Platform, and create a legally binding
                        arrangement to abide by the same.

                        The Platform is owned and operated by Bundl Technologies Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated
                        under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its registered office at No.55, Sy No.8-14, Ground Floor, I&J Block,
                        Embassy Tech Village, Outer Ring Road, Devarbisanahalli, Bengaluru – 560103, Karnataka, India. For the purpose
                        of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so requires, "you", “user”, or “User” shall mean any natural or
                        legal person who shall transaction on the Platform by providing registration data while registering on the
                        Platform as a registered user using any computer systems. The terms "Swiggy", "we", "us" or "our" shall mean
                        Bundl Technologies Private Limited.

                        Swiggy enables transactions on its Platform between participating restaurants/merchants and buyers, dealing in (a)
                        prepared food and beverages, (b) consumer goods, and (c) other products and services ("Platform Services"). The
                        buyers ("Buyer/s") can choose and place orders ("Orders") from a variety of products and services listed and
                        offered for sale by various merchants including but not limited to the restaurants, eateries and grocery stores
                        ("Merchant/s"), on the Platform. Further, the Buyer can also place Orders for undertaking certain tasks on the
                        Platform (“Tasks”).

                        Swiggy enables delivery of such Orders or completion of Tasks at select localities of serviceable cities across
                        India ("Delivery Services") by connecting third party service providers i.e. pick-up and delivery partners (“PDP”)
                        who will be responsible for providing the pick-up and delivery services and completing Tasks initiated by the
                        users of the Platform (Buyers or Merchants). The Platform Services and Delivery Services are collectively
                        referred to as "Services". For both Platform Services and Delivery Services, Swiggy is merely acting as an
                        intermediary between the Merchants and Buyers and/or PDPs and Buyers/Merchants.

                        PDPs are individual entrepreneurs engaged with Swiggy on a voluntary, non-exclusive and principal to principal
                        basis to provide aforementioned services for service fee. PDPs are independent contractors and are free to
                        determine their timings of work.  Swiggy does not exercise control on the PDPs and the relationship between the
                        PDPs and Swiggy is not that of an agent and principal or employee and employer.


                        For the pickup and delivery services and completing the Tasks, PDPs may charge the users of the Platform (Buyers
                        or Merchants), a service fee (inclusive of applicable taxes whenever not expressly mentioned) determined on the
                        basis of various factors including but not limited to distance covered, time taken, demand for delivery
                        services/Tasks, real time analysis of traffic and weather conditions, seasonal peaks or such other parameters
                        as may be determined from time to time.

                        <h2>Use of Platform and Services</h2>

                        All commercial/contractual terms are offered by and agreed to between Buyers and Merchants alone with respect
                        to products and services being offered by the Merchants. The commercial/contractual terms include without
                        limitation price, applicable taxes, shipping costs, payment terms, date, period and mode of delivery, warranties
                        related to products and services and after sales services related to products and services. Swiggy does not
                        have any control or does not determine or advise or in any way involve itself in the offering or acceptance
                        of such commercial/contractual terms between the Buyers and Merchants. Swiggy may, however, offer support
                        services to Merchants in respect to Order fulfilment, mode of payment, payment collection, call centre
                        support and other ancillary services, pursuant to independent contracts executed by Swiggy with the
                        Merchants. The price of the product and services offered by the Merchant are determined by the Merchant
                        itself and Swiggy has no role to play in such determination of price in any way whatsoever.

                        Upon acceptance of any Order or Task by the PDPs, the pickup and delivery services or Task completion services
                        (as the case may be) undertaken by him/her, shall constitute a separate contract for services between
                        Merchants/Buyers and PDPs. Swiggy shall not be responsible for the services provided by PDP to Merchants/Buyers
                        through the Platform. Swiggy may, however, offer support services to PDPs in respect of Order fulfilment,
                        payment collection, call centre support, and other ancillary services, pursuant to independent contracts
                        executed by Swiggy with the PDPs.

                        Swiggy does not make any representation or warranty as to the item-specifics (such as legal title,
                        creditworthiness, identity, etc.) of any of the Merchants. You are advised to independently verify the bona fides
                        of any particular Merchant that you choose to deal with on the Platform and use your best judgment on that
                        behalf. All Merchant offers and third-party offers are subject to respective party terms and conditions.
                        Swiggy takes no responsibility for such offers.

                        Swiggy neither make any representation or warranty as to specifics (such as quality, value, salability, etc.) of
                        the products or services proposed to be sold or offered to be sold or purchased on the Platform nor does
                        implicitly or explicitly support or endorse the sale or purchase of any products or services on the Platform.
                        Swiggy accepts no liability for any errors or omissions, whether on behalf of itself or third parties.

                        Swiggy does not make any representation or warranty with respect to any aspect of the services being provided by
                        the PDPs through the Platform including but not limited to pick up and delivery services and Task completion
                        services to the Merchants or Buyers as the case may be.

                        Swiggy is not responsible for any non-performance or breach of any contract entered into between Buyers and
                        Merchants, and between Merchants/Buyers and PDP on the Platform. Swiggy cannot and does not guarantee that the
                        concerned Buyers, Merchants and PDPs will perform any transaction concluded on the Platform. Swiggy is not
                        responsible for unsatisfactory or non-performance of services or damages or delays as a result of products
                        which are out of stock, unavailable or back ordered.

                        Swiggy is operating an online marketplace and assumes the role of facilitator, and does not at any point of time
                        during any transaction between Buyer and Merchant and/or Buyer and PDP on the Platform come into or take
                        possession of any of the products or services offered by Merchant or PDP. At no time shall Swiggy hold any right,
                        title or interest over the products nor shall Swiggy have any obligations or liabilities in respect of such
                        contract entered into between Buyer and Merchant and/or Buyer and PDP.

                        Swiggy is only providing a platform for communication and it is agreed that the contract for sale of any of the
                        products or services shall be a strictly bipartite contract between the Merchant and the Buyer. In case of
                        complaints from the Buyer pertaining to efficacy, quality, or any other such issues, Swiggy shall notify the same
                        to Merchant and shall also redirect the Buyer to the consumer call center of the Merchant. The Merchant shall
                        be liable for redressing Buyer complaints. In the event you raise any complaint on any Merchant accessed using
                        our Platform, we shall assist you to the best of our abilities by providing relevant information to you, such
                        as details of the Merchant and the specific Order to which the complaint relates, to enable satisfactory
                        resolution of the complaint.

                        Similar to the above, Swiggy is only providing a platform for communication with PDP and does not provide any
                        pick-up and delivery services or Task completion services with respect to the Orders placed by Merchants/Buyers
                        on the Platform as it is merely facilitating Delivery Services by connecting the Merchants/Buyers with the PDP
                        through the Platform. In case of complaints by the Merchants/Buyers for deficiency or lapse in the delivery
                        services or Task completion services provided by PDP, Swiggy shall notify the same to the PDP and also assist
                        Merchants/Buyers to the best of its abilities to enable satisfactory resolution of the complaint.

                        Please note that there could be risks in dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretence.
